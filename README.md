# capstone project: Self Balancing Bicycle

* For our capstone final project, we wanted to tackle the problem of self stabilization of an object. This sort of technology has applications in self-driving vehicles.
* To accomplish this, we decided to go with the building of a model from the ground up using Autodesk Inventor and 3D printing our parts.
* NOTE: this is a working directory
